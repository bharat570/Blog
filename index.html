        Most People have a missconception that is AI is/are Robots. But that's defienetly not the case , AI is something that can think,create,craft,make calculations on Data  <i> far better than Humans could ever do</i>-- but at present they can not be present in the <u>Physical World</u> but only in <i>Digital World</i>. AI can be Integrated into Robots, machines etc. and making them do things do things that Humans cannot do easily and faster.

        Understanding Terms that comes under AI:
        <ol>
            <li> <b> Machine Learning </b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Machine Learning lets computers learn from data without being programmed step-by-step.
                    Instead of strict instructions, it improves itself by finding patterns in data.</li>
                    <li>A spam filter, for example, learns to detect unwanted emails over time.
                        The more examples it sees, the better it becomes at predictions.</li>
                    <li>Think of it as teaching a machine through examples rather than fixed rules.</li>
            </ul>
            <li> <b> Deep Learning</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with many layers.
                    Each layer learns more complex patterns from the data.</li>
                    <li>It powers tech like image recognition, voice assistants, and self-driving cars.
                        It needs large amounts of data and high computing power.</li>
                        <li>You can think of it as teaching machines to “see” and “hear” like humans.</li>
            </ul>
            <li> <b> Generative AI</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Generative AI creates new content — text, images, music, or videos.
                    Instead of only analyzing data, it generates something entirely new.</li>
                <li>Examples include ChatGPT and Gemini, which create text or art from prompts.
                    It’s widely used in design, marketing, and entertainment.</li>
                <li>Generative AI doesn’t just “think” — it “creates.”</li>
            </ul>
            <li> <b> Data Science</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Science involves collecting, cleaning, and analyzing large amounts of data.
                    It blends statistics, coding, and subject knowledge to make sense of information.</li>
                <li>Companies use it to improve products, understand customers, and predict trends.
                    It ensures AI systems have quality data to learn from.</li>
                <li>Without Data Science, AI would have no meaningful knowledge base.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
